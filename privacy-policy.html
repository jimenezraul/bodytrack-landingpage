    <h1 class="mb-4">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="text-muted">Last updated: March 06, 2025</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how BodyTrack ("the App") handles your information when you use our Service. Please read this Policy carefully. By using our Service, you agree to the practices described herein.</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>BodyTrack</strong> is a fitness tracking app that does <strong>not</strong> require users to create an account. The developer does not collect or store any personal data. The only data processed externally is that collected by third-party services, such as Google AdMob, for serving personalized advertisements.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection and Processing</h2>
    <h3>Third-Party Advertising</h3>
    <p>We use third-party services, including <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, to display advertisements within the App. Google AdMob may collect and use certain information (such as advertising identifiers, device information, and behavioral data) to provide personalized advertisements. For more details on how Google handles your data, please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Local Data Processing</h3>
    <p>All other data processing occurs solely on your device. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Workout Routes:</strong> When you use the workout feature, the App accesses your location data to record your workout route. This data is stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device and is not transmitted to any server.</li>
      <li><strong>Health Data:</strong> With your permission, the App accesses HealthKit data such as calories burned and steps taken. This data is used exclusively within the App and remains on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> The App may request permission to send you notifications for meal logs, water reminders, and workout prompts. These notifications help you stay on track and are not used to collect personal data.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since no personal data is collected or stored by the developer (except as provided by third-party services like Google AdMob), your privacy is inherently protected. All processing of sensitive information (such as location or HealthKit data) is done locally on your device and only with your explicit consent.</p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>While we take care to ensure that your data remains secure on your device, please remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. It is important that you manage the permissions and security settings on your device appropriately.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page along with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about our practices.</p>
